# Hey 👋

I'm **Athul Cyriac Ajay**, a ***Site Reliability Engineer*** from Kerala, India. I love working with infrastructure, writing code, and solving interesting problems.

Currently working as an **SRE at [KnowBe4](https://knowbe4.com)** in ***Release Engineering***, where I get to work on _distributed systems_, _GitLab infrastructure_, and helping teams deploy things faster and more reliably.

Before this, I spent a couple of years at **[Frappe](https://frappe.io)** as a ***Platform Engineer***, working on _cloud infrastructure_ and making **ERPNext deployments smoother** for customers.


I've been lucky to work on some cool projects like implementing **GitLab Geo across regions** and building systems that track **AI adoption metrics** at KnowBe4.

I enjoy building tools and contributing to **open source**. Some projects that people seem to find useful include **[Waka-Readme](https://github.com/athul/waka-readme)** (a GitHub Action that shows coding stats on your profile with ***1,700+ stars***), **[Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie)** (the minimal Hugo theme that powers this site with ***1,200+ stars***), and **[Shelby](https://github.com/athul/shelby)** (a fast shell prompt written in Go with ***180+ stars***). Check out more of my [Projects](/projects) or my [Resume](/resume) if you're curious about the technical details.

I primarily write **Python** and **Go**, work a lot with **AWS** and **Terraform**, and enjoy building things with **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Vue.js**. Most of my day involves _Docker containers_, _GitLab CI/CD_, and various _monitoring tools_.

When I'm not coding, I have a thing for building **[mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)** - especially _split keyboards_ like the **CRKBD** and **KLOR**. There's something satisfying about soldering switches and getting that perfect typing feel. I love exploring Kerala on weekend bike trips, watching movies, and sometimes just sleeping in. I also write about my projects and experiences on my [blog](/blog), and occasionally publish technical articles for **[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/aajay)** and **[LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/athulcyriac/)**.

I graduated with a **B.Tech in Computer Science** from [College of Engineering Kidangoor](https://ce-kgr.org) under [APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University](https://ktu.edu.in) in 2022, where I was fortunate to receive the ***Best Outgoing Student Award***. I've been writing code since **2018**, starting with _Python_ after high school. Before that, it was mostly _C++_ for school projects.

Always happy to chat about _tech_, _keyboards_, or anything interesting. You can find me on **Twitter** [@athulcajay](https://x.com/athulcajay), **GitHub** [athul](https://github.com/athul), **Telegram** [@a2hu1](https://t.me/a2hu1), or **email** athul8720[@]gmail[.]com.
